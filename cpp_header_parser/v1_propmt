Generate python script based on the previous defination, the script functionals like below:
- retrieve structs from a C++ header file.
- cpp header file contains some user defined structs, maybe they are nested
- cpp header file contains comments
- cpp header file are not guarteened to be well formatted
- cpp header file didn't contain any user defined template classes/structs
- cpp header file only contains structs
- cpp header file might contains orther elements, eg: function declaretion, enum, variables, using namespace ... and other feature that cpp supported 
- variable file in cpp header file might be user defined struct, pod type or std container or other types included from other header files
- generate code in main to automatically test the parsing result
- support to print the global structs in json format, the output should be like: {struct_name: {variable_name: variable_type, ...}, ...}, and print the global struct in readable format in main function
