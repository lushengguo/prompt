After several round of prompt
I found that chatgpt is prone to generate short and brief code 
Even if I asked it to genrate full code, it needs a lot of round to generate a code that looks 'might' meet my requiements
But in reality didn't work at all 

In deepseek, it seems like that it performs better in listening to me 
But it's still promblematic to fall in error loop
The best solution is me find the problem and tell it

Bot of them didn't work in the end 

It's hard for me to accept cursor's performance, but in my own hand the LLM performs worse
